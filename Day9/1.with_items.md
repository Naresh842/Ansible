# with_items

In Ansible, `with_items` is a looping construct used to iterate over a list of items. It allows you to execute a task multiple times, each time with a different item from the list. This is particularly useful when you need to apply the same operation to multiple objects, such as installing multiple packages or creating multiple users.

### Example: Using `with_items` on a Local Host

Let's create a simple Ansible playbook that installs a list of packages on a local host using `with_items`.

#### Step 1: Create the Inventory File

```ini
# inventory
localhost ansible_connection=local
```

This inventory file specifies that the `localhost` should be managed via the local connection.

#### Step 2: Create the Ansible Playbook

Here's a sample playbook named `install_packages.yml` that uses `with_items` to install multiple packages on the local host.

```yaml
---
- name: Install multiple packages on localhost
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items:
        - git
        - curl
        - vim
```

#### Explanation:
- **`hosts: localhost`**: Specifies that this playbook should run on the local host.
- **`become: yes`**: Grants root privileges to install the packages.
- **`apt:`**: This is the Ansible module for managing packages on Debian-based systems. You can replace it with `yum` if you're on a Red Hat-based system.
- **`with_items:`**: This is the loop directive that iterates over the list of packages (`git`, `curl`, `vim`) and installs each one.

#### Step 3: Run the Playbook

To execute the playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory install_packages.yml
```

### Output

When you run the playbook, Ansible will install the specified packages one by one on the local host.

```bash
PLAY [Install multiple packages on localhost] **********************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Install packages] ********************************************************
changed: [localhost] => (item=git)
changed: [localhost] => (item=curl)
changed: [localhost] => (item=vim)

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

### Example Summary:
This example demonstrated how to use `with_items` in an Ansible playbook to install multiple packages on a local host. The playbook iterates over each package in the list and ensures it is installed.

You can use `with_items` in various scenarios, such as creating users, managing files, or setting up configurations, making it a powerful tool in your Ansible toolkit.
